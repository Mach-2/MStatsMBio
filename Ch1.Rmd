# 1. Generative Models for Discrete Data

### 1.2 example

Display how often 3 mutations would occur in the Poisson(5) model: 

```{r dpois2}
dpois(x = 3, lambda = 5)
```

Okay, I think I've got this RMarkdown business (partially) figured out! 

We can also vector our probabilities for all values 0 to 12:

``` {r dpois3}
dpois(x = 0:12, lambda = 5)
```

``` {r dpois4, ehco =FALSE}
barplot(dpois(0:12,5), names.arg = 0:12, col = "purple")
```


### 1.3 Discrete probability models

**Q 1.1**
What if you want to create a factor that has some levels not yet in your data?

**Answer**
```{r factors}
genotype = c("AA","AO","BB","AO","OO")

genotypeF = factor(c(genotype,"Level"))

levels(genotypeF)
```
